# Tech Company Frontend Challenge

**Disclaimer: the original name of the company has been anonymized, we'll call them "TC" from now on!**

Welcome to my frontend challenge! This project will cover the main features and functionalities shown in the example design given by TC.
The work has been done in the 'develop' branch of this repository, with clear commit titles and a proper development order, starting from project initialization with Next.js, to a setup of the main variables, and thus developing each component. The work is then merged on the 'main' branch, ready to be tested and analyzed by others.

## Usage

This demo project lets the user navigate through the left-side routing menu panel, showing each option's content on the right-side panel, currently containing only the "API Key" section, as per assignment.

The dark/light switch is also present, allowing the user to switch between the two themes on the top-right toggle.

The user can also press the Edit button in the right side of the info entries, opening a modal (not fully implemented).
